# clean-directory
It's just a simple script to maintain my file name convention.
For now I don't bother to explore in depth the children directories, so it's not recursive.
I don't find it time efficient to implement it.

### Requirements
Node

### Installation
Clone the repo wherever you want. In my case I have a symbolic link to my executables folder.

### Run
```sh
node cleandirectory.js ~/directorytoformat
```
